## Algorithm Implementation

### Kalman Filter Design

The system implements three specialized Kalman filters:

1. **Weight Filter** (3-state): Estimates weight, velocity, and acceleration
2. **Drip Rate Filter** (2-state): Processes drip timing with adaptive parameters
3. **Data Fusion Filter** (1-state each): Combines sensor estimates

### State Estimation

```text
State Vector (Weight Filter):
[weight(g), velocity(g/s), acceleration(g/s²)]

Process Model:
weight(k+1) = weight(k) + velocity(k)*dt + 0.5*acceleration(k)*dt²
velocity(k+1) = velocity(k) + acceleration(k)*dt
acceleration(k+1) = acceleration(k) + process_noise
```

### Performance Characteristics

- Measurement update rate: 1 Hz
- Filter convergence time: <60 seconds
- Weight measurement precision: ±0.5g
- Flow rate estimation accuracy: ±2%

## API Interface

The system provides RESTful API endpoints for external integration:

- `GET /api/status` - Current system status
- `POST /api/calibrate` - Initiate sensor calibration
- `GET /api/data` - Real-time monitoring data

WebSocket endpoint available at port 81 for real-time data streaming.

## Development Notes

### Filter Parameter Tuning

Filter parameters are configurable via `include/Config.h`. Key parameters:

- Process noise (Q): Controls filter responsiveness
- Measurement noise (R): Reflects sensor accuracy
- Initial covariance (P): Sets convergence characteristics

### Debugging

Serial output provides real-time debugging information:
- Filter states and covariances
- Sensor raw measurements
- Processing timing statistics
- Network communication status

## Performance Analysis

The system has been validated with the following performance metrics:

- Steady-state estimation error: <1% of measured value
- Response time to flow rate changes: <30 seconds
- False alarm rate for abnormality detection: <0.1%
